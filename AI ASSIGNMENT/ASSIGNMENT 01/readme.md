### QUESTION 3: Personal Fitness AI Agent

#### *Performance Measure*
* Achieving daily and long-term health goals, including:
  * Calorie intake
  * Exercise completion
  * Sleep quality
  * Mental activity levels
  * Relaxation and stress management

#### *Environment*
* **Type:** Virtual (data collected through user interactions)

#### *Actuators*
* Camera
* Touchscreen
* Voice interface
* Keyboard input

#### *Sensors*
* Text-based questions (user input)
* Image recognition (for calorie counting or activity tracking via camera or scanner)

#### *Environment Characteristics*
* **Continuous:** Data is continuously updated as the user logs information, and goals are dynamically adjusted.
* **Accessible:** The agent has access to all user-defined goals and initial body state.
* **Single Agent:** The AI works independently to assist a single user.
* **Cooperative:** The agent's purpose is to support the user in achieving fitness goals.
* **Nondeterministic:** The outcome is uncertain since user compliance cannot be guaranteed.
* **Known:** The agent has knowledge of health guidelines, nutrition data, and exercise routines.
* **Partially Observable:** The agent can only access the data provided by the user, not the user's full activity or lifestyle.
* **Sequential:** The agent needs to track past interactions, preferences, and goal progression over time.
* **Dynamic:** Goals may change based on user preferences or evolving circumstances.

#### *Best Agent Architecture*
* **Goal-Based Agent:** Makes decisions to achieve user-defined goals (e.g., completing a daily workout or staying within a calorie limit). It selects actions that bring the user closer to those goals.
* **Utility-Based Agent:** Assigns utility values to different states (e.g., better sleep = higher utility) and recommends actions that maximize overall well-being and long-term fitness success.

### QUESTION 4: Assertions About Rational Agents

1. **True:** It cannot be rational all the time, especially if unobservable information plays an important part. For example, a taxi driver agent cannot observe the back view and doesnâ€™t see a motorcycle speeding up and changing lanes. If the agent changes lanes at that time, it would not be rational.

2. **True:** Reflex agents only act based on the current percept, without considering history or context. For example, in a stock exchange environment, it is necessary to have both prior knowledge and current trade data to make rational decisions.

3. **True:** For simple environments, an agent with even limited functionality and percepts can be programmed to be rational. For instance, in a room with a single button that must be pressed to win, any agent that presses the button would be rational.

4. **False:** The input to an agent program might be different from what the agent function uses. For example, the percept could be raw sensory data, but the program processes this data to decide the action.

5. **False:** Not every agent function is implementable due to physical limitations like memory and computation time. For example, an agent trying to compute the perfect chess move might run out of time or resources, making it impossible to implement the optimal function.

6. **True:** Randomization can sometimes lead to success. For example, a vacuum agent moving randomly might accidentally find and clean dirt, achieving the goal by chance.

7. **True:** It is possible for an agent to be perfectly rational in two distinct task environments. For example, a random number generator might produce the correct value for some search solutions in different environments.
